I need a complete java program structure. I will download and use on several computers

I want to use AI and Agentic AI to create a modern Java application from scratch.
Let's make it a modern web app.
It should work without database as backend, this is a poc.
But it should have some functionality - it will be used to exemplify LLM developer usage
We won't have a real backend, this is for a demo so all our backend storage will be in-memory
Can you create a sample application - a shopping list application
* App should show look old - think 2005 web - we want to have as an excecise to smarten up the UI
* It should display a list of shopping lists (e.g. "Grocery list friday", "Weekend party", "School start clothes", ..)
* Selecting a shoppping-list should open the list and show the content
* It should be possible to add, edit and remove items (free text) in the list
* It should be possible to add or remove shopping lists
* It should not be possible to rename a shopping list (this will be an excercise later)
* There should be a button to reset the application, removing all changes done and showing the default lists.
Make a plan for how you would like to do this and let me check it
